Learning how to use Github

This is my first Branch.

Hi - I am known as Forthemn.
I am interested in Climate Change & Biodiversity solutions, Engineering (Mech & Elec) and Information Theory.

I have come to realise that in order to keep up with the modern world, I have to some basic understanding of the technology which underpins modern-day information-based / software based solutions.

This is why I am github!
